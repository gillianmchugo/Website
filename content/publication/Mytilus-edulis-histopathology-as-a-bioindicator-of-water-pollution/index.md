abstract: "*Mytilus edulis* mussels are frequently used as bioindicators of water pollution. Sections of the mussels can be examined microscopically for abnormalities (histopathology) and compared between sites with known differences in pollution levels to validate them as biomarkers of pollution. This study examines mussels collected in Newquay, Co. Clare or transplanted from Newquay to Dublin Bay for 2 or 4 months. When analysed individually none of the 19 histopathological variables examined were good biomarkers of pollution. 4 variables were absent in all mussels and 9 were present but not in significantly different proportions between the sites. 6 were present in significantly different proportions but also had a statistically significant difference between the initial samples from each site, which were collected from the same population and exposed to the same levels of pollution. When the results for each variable were combined together into a histopathological score, indicating overall mussel health, a statistically significant result was found. However it was affected by the sex of the mussels, since there were differences in the ratio of male and female mussels in the samples. To correct this one variable that was clearly affected by sex (atresia; the degeneration of the female oocytes) was removed. This new histopathological score was found to be a potential biomarker of water pollution since it was significantly higher in mussels that spent the duration of the study in the more polluted site and was not affected by sex, however its use is questionable since the individual variables were not significant."
