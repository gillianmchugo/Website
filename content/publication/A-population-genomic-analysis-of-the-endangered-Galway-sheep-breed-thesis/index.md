abstract: The endangered Galway sheep is the only native Irish sheep breed, and an important genetic resource. Population genomic analyses of the Galway breed in comparison with other sheep populations of European origin revealed their recent evolutionary history. This confirmed the use of the Border Leicester breed in the formation of the Galway breed and more recent gene flow with the Suffolk breed. The Galway breed also had unique signatures of artificial selection when compared to other breeds, which highlighted candidate genes that may be involved in meat and wool production. When compared to both commercial and endangered breeds, the Galway breed was intermediate in effective population size (*N*<sub>e</sub>), genomic inbreeding and runs of homozygosity (ROH). This indicates that, although the Galway breed is declining, it is still relatively genetically diverse and careful conservation and management plans may aid its recovery.
