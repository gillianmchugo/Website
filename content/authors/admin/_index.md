## About me
I am a PhD student at University College Dublin, working with [Professor David E. MacHugh](https://people.ucd.ie/david.machugh "people.ucd.ie/david.machugh") and 
[Professor Stephen V. Gordon.](https://people.ucd.ie/stephen.gordon "people.ucd.ie/stephen.gordon") 
I am currently studying integrative genomics of infectious diseases in cattle, focusing on trypanosomiasis in hybrid African cattle and bovine tuberculosis in Irish cattle.
