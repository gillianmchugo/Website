Files used to make my personal website: [**gillianmchugo.github.io**.](https://gillianmchugo.github.io/) Created with [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) [**blogdown**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown) using [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) [**Academic**](https://sourcethemes.com/academic) and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) [**Pages**.](https://pages.github.com/) The `blogdown::serve_site()` command generates the files in the [**'public'**](https://github.com/GillianMcHugo/gillianmchugo.github.io) directory, which are hosted as a GitHub submodule.
